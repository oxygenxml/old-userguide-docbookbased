# old-userguide-docbookbased
The old Oxygen Users Manual contents stored as a monolythical Docbook file. It may be useful as a sample real-life project.
We did not use xi:include so it's a single 3MBs XML document.
About 5 years ago we migrated our Docbook-based documentation document to a DITA project:
